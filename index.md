Hello! Welcome to **Rohan Tan Bhowmik**'s website.

# About Me

I am an sophomore undergraduate at Stanford University studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. I am also a research intern at the Sean N. Parker Center of Stanford School of Medicine.

<!-- I am passionate about artificial intelligence, constantly seeking to learn and develop new machine-learning techniques and build applications based on them, especially in the areas of health, environment, and human-computer interaction.

Outside of academics, I participate in school orchestra as a clarinetist, play tennis, and volunteer with organizations to help sensory-deficient individuals, including the Baker Institute for Children with Hearing Loss, Starkey Hearing Foundation, and VocaliD. -->

<!-- I am a final-year undergrad majoring in EECS at Fuzhou University and Maynooth University (Combined Degrees). Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the IIoT-Lab, advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhezhuang-Xu) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meng-Yuan-4). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at Cambridge University. Recently, I have been selected as an **AAAI & KDD UC Scholar**. -->
