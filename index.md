<h2>About me</h2>

I am an incoming freshman and Egleston Scholar (top 1% of admitted class) at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University. I am also a research intern at the Sean N. Parker Center of Stanford University School of Medicine.

I am passionate about artificial intelligence, constantly seeking to learn and develop new machine-learning techniques and build applications based on them, especially in the areas of health, environment, and human-computer interaction.

Outside of academics, I volunteer with organizations to help sensory-deficient individuals, including the Baker Institute for Children with Hearing Loss, Starkey Hearing Foundation, and VocaliD.
